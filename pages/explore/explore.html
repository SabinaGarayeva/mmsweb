          <h2>We help people feel included by championing fun as a way to share our true-self and connect with others.
          </h2>
          <p>M&M’S is a chocolate brand on a mission. We believe in championing the power of fun to create a world where
            everyone feels they belong.</p>
          <p>We’ve been a fun brand for a long time, but now it’s time to take that FUN to the next level. Make it
            meaningful. Make it powerful. Make it a movement.</p>
          <p>A movement that unites the masses by inviting everyone to be part of something bigger than just fun for
            fun’s sake. After all, fun is meant to be inclusive, for all.</p>
          <p>Better yet, for all Funkind. This is our rallying cry to drive a global movement to remind people
            everywhere that, despite our differences, we all belong to a community of humans that share one simple and
            powerful thing in common: fun.</p>
          <p>To foster this world of belonging, M&M’S® has also launched The M&M’S FUNd which is a global initiative
            intended to track the brand’s impact on its mission to increase the sense of belonging for 10MM by 2025.</p>
          <p>The M&M’S FUNd provides resources, mentorship, opportunities and financial support in the arts and
            entertainment space to help ensure people have access to experiences where everyone feels they belong.</p>
          <p>Because together, we can make this a reality for all Funkind.</p>

            <p>Our Super Bowl campaign brought the fun back into the conversation in a new way. While there were
              many
              twists and turns along the journey - especially as the spokescandies took the chance to explore other
              passions - our purpose remained at the core, bringing us all together to share in laughter and fun.

            <p>To celebrate the official return of the M&M'S® spokescandies, the brand doubled down on its most
              recent
              initiative: supporting women who are flipping the status quo. The brand increased the number of
              $10,000
              grants offered to change-making women from 10 to 20, putting the "fun" in funding their initiatives
              while increasing the opportunity for trailblazing women to champion a positive impact on society. The
              winners were identified in partnership with the M&M'S FUNd Advisory Council and spotlighted across
              M&M'S
              digital and social platforms on International Women's Day (Wednesday, March 8).</p>
